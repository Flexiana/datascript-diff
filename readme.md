# Test task for RoamResearch (RR)

This project is a test task to implements a diff algorithm, it works with some **Clojure/Script** data-structures, these are:

- Vectors, e.g. `[1 2 3 4]`.
- Maps, e.g. `{:key "value"}`.

The project was developed to be used mainly with ClojureScript, but some namespaces ware wrote with `cljc` extension for [portable files in multiple Clojure platforms](https://clojure.org/reference/reader#_reader_conditionals)

### What?

It is a project to show the capability of Flexiana to potential customer.

- Make use of the algorithm to show differences between two inputs, that's it using the GUI (frontend interface).
- Make use of the algorithm to test the differences between two sources of code, that's it using data from RoamResearch API.

### Installation

If you are using macOS or Linux the only dependencies required for this project are:

- Yarn (package manager).
- NodeJS (JavaScript runtime).
- Clojure (programming language).

Then you can run `yarn` to install dependencies, later you can run some environment:

- `yarn serve` to show the GUI in the browser (opens http://localhost:8080).
- `yarn test` to run the test directory (it contains tests that prove diff algorithm with some data).
